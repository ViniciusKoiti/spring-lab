# Plan

## Goals
- [ ] Create a Python runner that executes async and sync flows multiple times and compares results across increasing job sizes.
- [ ] Provide a repeatable report output (CSV) and clear usage instructions.

## Steps
1. [x] Inspect existing scripts to align inputs/outputs and choose output format.
2. [x] Implement the Python comparison runner with polling, timeouts, and CSV output.
3. [x] Document usage in the script header and ensure results directory handling.
4. [x] Update plan status and prepare a commit with all changes.
